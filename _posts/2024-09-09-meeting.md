## Lab Meetings
Every doctoral student may have memories of lab meetings.  
Here are few tips for making successful lab meetings from my experience.  

---

## Presenter
Prepare your material according to ‘[scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#Elements_of_inquiry)’ as much as possible!

### Basic Settings
Please don’t just enumerate what you have done, and stick to the time limit as conference presentation (25 min.)
- Time is gold.
- Our concentration is limited; that’s why Pomodoro timer is usually set to 25 minutes.
- Please prepare your presentation seamlessly and carefully to make our lab meeting meaningful.

### Contents
#### I. Introduction
- Introduce clear definition of the target problem.
- Give your lab mates a quick refresher or the importance of your work.

#### II. Observation & Background
- Introduce from where, and why you found it is really a 'problem'?
  - Provide summaries of related works you read & keywords used for finding/defining such works.
- Conducting a research is like debugging a program with other researchers around the world.
  - Without knowing what the previous bug is, (and whether it has already been fixed or not), any research is pointless…
  - Please DON'T reinvent the wheel!!!

#### III. Hypothesis
- Introduce the very point(s) that you'd like to make a progress on top of existing works.
- Please escribe in a compact sentence containing core keywords.  

<b>Template</b>: [<font color='orange'>independent variable(s) / your idea</font>] will [<font color='green'>expected effect</font>] on [<font color='skyblue'>dependent variable / target field of interest</font>] in [<font color='violet'>specific condition / essential assumption</font>]

{% details Example %}
> <b>Example</b>: [<font color='orange'><i>A server-side online convex optimization on mixing coefficients</i></font>] will [<font color='green'><i>induce better performance uniformity</i></font>] on [<font color='skyblue'><i>both cross-silo & cross-device federated learning</i></font>] in [<font color='violet'><i>a single model-based, honest server and reliable clients in federated setting</i></font>] (See [AAggFF (ICML`24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20821) for more details)
{% enddetails %}

#### IV. Objective
- Summarize in <u>a compact sentence</u> what you have been trying before a lab meeting.
- <b>Example 1</b>) To investigate FTRL framework can be adopted to federated setting with client sampling.
- <b>Example 2</b>) To prove convergence behavior of my proposed method.

#### V. Experimental Results
- Please at first summarize your results in a sentence.
- Then, please answer following questions:
  - How and why did you design experiments to test your hypothesis?
  - What do the results imply about your hypothesis?

#### VI. Discussion
- Wrap-up your thoughts and provide future plans.
- Request critical feedback from your lab mates.

## Audience
Please think as if you are a (good) reviewer.
- There is no better guideline than [ICLR reviewer guideline](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/ReviewerGuide#Reviewing%20instructions)
- Read the guideline thoroughly and try to help the presenter's work _to be acceptable_ to external researchers.
- Avoid attacking/criticizing the presenter, he/she is your lab mate!
