(and may be preparing a meeting right now..)<br/> Here are some tips for successful lab meetings from my experience.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="presenter">Presenter</h2> <p>Prepare your material according to ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#Elements_of_inquiry">scientific method</a>’ as much as possible!</p> <h3 id="basic-settings">Basic Settings</h3> <p>Please don’t just enumerate what you’ve done, and please stick to the time limit as if it were a conference presentation (25 minutes).</p> <ul> <li>Your &amp; our time is gold.</li> <li>Human’s concentration is limited. That’s why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro technique</a> usually suggests 25 minutes timer.</li> <li>Please prepare your presentation seamlessly and carefully to make the lab meeting meaningful for everyone. <ul> <li>Take ownership: no one knows every detail of your work better than you.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="template">Template</h3> <h4 id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</h4> <ul> <li>Introduce a clear definition of the target problem.</li> <li>Give your lab mates a quick refresher on the topic you are working on and the importance of your work.</li> </ul> <h4 id="ii-observation--background">II. Observation &amp; Background</h4> <ul> <li>Introduce from where, and why you found it is really a “problem”? <ul> <li>Provide summaries of related works you have read &amp; keywords used to find/define such works.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Where can I find meaningful problems? <ul> <li>For Master students/industry-biased) you can find a problem from industries you are interested in (e.g., see the requirements sections in job postings!)</li> <li>For Doctoral students/academy-biased) you can find a problem from papers, or by communicating with other researchers (e.g., conferences/twitters/reddits), or by cloning GitHub repo. of previous works and playing with them, …</li> </ul> </li> <li>Conducting a research is like “debugging codes” with other researchers around the world. <ul> <li>Without knowing what the previous bug is, (and whether it has already been fixed or not), any patches/updates are pointless…</li> <li>Please DON’T <mark>"imagine"</mark> a research problem… You need to cross-check if there is agreement among other researchers that the problem you found is indeed a problem. (Before making PR, you make an issue first, innit?)</li> <li><mark>Please DON'T DON'T DON'T reinvent the wheel!!!</mark></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4 id="iii-hypothesis">III. Hypothesis</h4> <ul> <li>Provide the very point(s) that you’d like to make a progress on existing works.</li> <li>Please describe in a compact sentence containing core keywords.</li> <li>It becomes the main thesis of the paper</li> </ul> <p><b>Template</b>: [<font color="orange">independent variable(s) / your idea</font>] will [<font color="green">expected effect</font>] on [<font color="skyblue">dependent variable / target field of interest</font>] in [<font color="violet">specific condition / essential assumption</font>]</p> <details><summary>Example)</summary> <p>[<font color="orange"><i>A server-side online convex optimization on mixing coefficients</i></font>] will [<font color="green"><i>induce better performance uniformity</i></font>] on [<font color="skyblue"><i>both cross-silo &amp; cross-device federated learning</i></font>] in [<font color="violet"><i>a single model-based, honest server and reliable clients in federated setting</i></font>] (See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20821">AAggFF (ICML`24)</a> for more details)</p> </details> <h4 id="iv-objective">IV. Objective</h4> <ul> <li>Summarize in <u>a compact sentence</u> what you have tried before a lab meeting.</li> <li><b>Example</b>) To investigate FTRL framework can be adopted to federated setting even with client sampling.</li> </ul> <h4 id="v-experimental-results">V. Experimental Results</h4> <ul> <li>Summarize your results in a sentence.</li> <li>Then, answer the following questions: <ul> <li>How and why did you design experiments to test your hypothesis?</li> <li>What do the results imply about your hypothesis?</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4 id="vi-discussion">VI. Discussion</h4> <ul> <li>Wrap-up your thoughts and provide future plans based on the hypothesis and corresponding results.</li> <li>Request critical feedback from your labmates. <ul> <li>Please be specific about what you’d like to discuss.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="audience">Audience</h2> <p>Please think as if you are a (good) reviewer.</p> <ul> <li>There is no better guideline than <a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/ReviewerGuide#Reviewing%20instructions">ICLR reviewer guideline</a></li> <li>Read the guideline thoroughly and try to help the presenter’s work <em>to be acceptable</em> to external researchers.</li> <li>Avoid attacking/criticizing the presenter, he/she is your lab mate!</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name>Adam</name></author><category term="thought"/><category term="misc"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adam's principles on lab meeting in graduate school]]></summary></entry></feed>
