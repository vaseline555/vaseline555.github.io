Seok-Ju has recently recevied his Ph.D. (2024) in Industrial Engineering at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST; Republic of Korea :KR:), advised by Prof. [Junghye Lee](https://d3mlab.snu.ac.kr/members/professor) and Prof. [Gi-Soo Kim](https://sdm.unist.ac.kr/members/). 
He received his undergraduate (2019) and B.S. (2021) degrees in Industrial Engineering from UNIST.
He is now a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Engineering Research, Seoul National University (SNU; Republic of Korea :KR:).
Concurrently, he has been conscripted into the Republic of Korea Army as a technical research personnel since Sep. 2022. (Date of discharge: Aug. 2025)

Here are research keywords of Seok-Ju: `Federated Learning`; `Machine Learning for Science`. 
Seok-Ju is interested in solving various problems that are ubiquitous in practical federated learning algorithms.
His dissertation particularly focused on mitigating statistical heterogeneity in federated learning through three different perspectives: parameters, mixing coefficients, and local distributions. 
He also offered challenges to solve real-world problems with machine learning: predictive modeling for industrial processes and services and for a scientific method.
