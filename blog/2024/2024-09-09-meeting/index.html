Introduction</h4> <ul> <li>Introduce clear definition of the target problem.</li> <li>Give your lab mates a quick refresher or the importance of your work.</li> </ul> <h4 id="ii-observation--background">II. Observation &amp; Background</h4> <ul> <li>Introduce from where, and why you found it is really a ‘problem’? <ul> <li>Provide summaries of related works you read &amp; keywords used for finding/defining such works.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Conducting a research is like debugging a program with other researchers around the world. <ul> <li>Without knowing what the previous bug is, (and whether it has already been fixed or not), any research is pointless…</li> <li>Please DON’T reinvent the wheel!!!</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4 id="iii-hypothesis">III. Hypothesis</h4> <ul> <li>Introduce the very point(s) that you’d like to make a progress on top of existing works.</li> <li>Please escribe in a compact sentence containing core keywords. <b>Template</b>: [<font color="orange">independent variable(s) / your idea</font>] will [<font color="green">expected effect</font>] on [<font color="skyblue">dependent variable / target field of interest</font>] in [<font color="violet">specific condition / essential assumption</font>]</li> </ul> <details><summary>Example</summary> <blockquote> <p><b>Example</b>: [<font color="orange"><i>A server-side online convex optimization on mixing coefficients</i></font>] will [<font color="green"><i>induce better performance uniformity</i></font>] on [<font color="skyblue"><i>both cross-silo &amp; cross-device federated learning</i></font>] in [<font color="violet"><i>a single model-based, honest server and reliable clients in federated setting</i></font>] (See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20821" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AAggFF (ICML`24)</a> for more details)</p> </blockquote> </details> <h4 id="iv-objective">IV. Objective</h4> <ul> <li>Summarize in <u>a compact sentence</u> what you have been trying before a lab meeting.</li> <li> <b>Example 1</b>) To investigate FTRL framework can be adopted to federated setting with client sampling.</li> <li> <b>Example 2</b>) To prove convergence behavior of my proposed method.</li> </ul> <h4 id="v-experimental-results">V. Experimental Results</h4> <ul> <li>Please at first summarize your results in a sentence.</li> <li>Then, please answer following questions: <ul> <li>How and why did you design experiments to test your hypothesis?</li> <li>What do the results imply about your hypothesis?</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4 id="vi-discussion">VI. Discussion</h4> <ul> <li>Wrap-up your thoughts and provide future plans.</li> <li>Request critical feedback from your lab mates.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="audience">Audience</h2> <p>Please think as if you are a (good) reviewer.</p> <ul> <li>There is no better guideline than <a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/ReviewerGuide#Reviewing%20instructions" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ICLR reviewer guideline</a> </li> <li>Read the guideline thoroughly and try to help the presenter’s work <em>to be acceptable</em> to external researchers.</li> <li>Avoid attacking/criticizing the presenter, he/she is your lab mate!</li> </ul> <hr> </body></html>
